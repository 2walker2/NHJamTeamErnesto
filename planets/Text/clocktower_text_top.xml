		<Text>CEDRUS: We have confirmation. Solar stability is indeed decreasing, albeit at a slow rate. Spark will go supernova in a few weeks.</Text>

		<Text>MIACEAE: Perhaps we could restabilize the system at regular intervals. However, doing so would require the clan to remain here indefinitely.</Text>

		<ParentID>1</ParentID>
		<Text>MIACEAE: We would do well to broadcast our results to the other clans, Bromi. Though we may not have succeeded, what we have learned here may still be of some use. If we do restabilize the system, electromagnetic interference will prevent signals from being sent or received while we remain nearby.</Text>

		<Text>CANARAE: The rate at which supernovas are occuring continues to increase. Solar stabilization must be solved quickly before no more suitable stars remain.</Text>

		<Text>MIACEAE: It is time to move onwards. There is a festival shortly in the Blackrock system. Perhaps one of the other clans has found a solution.</Text>
