			<Page>Heya, hatchling. Yes, it's me, the famous Feldspar. Everything you've heard about is true.</Page>
			<Page>Except for the things that aren't.</Page>
			<Page>I'll be honest, it's weird being back here with all of you. I've spent so long flying around the Outer Wilds that I forgot how nice it is to share a song with Gneiss.</Page>
			<Page>Or a marshmallow with Slate.</Page>
			<Page>I'll rest for a while, but then I'll be ready to take off again.</Page>
			<Page>After all, it's not every day the sun rises on a new horizon.</Page>
