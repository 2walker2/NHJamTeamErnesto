			<Page>Hey, hatchling. Sorry you never had your grand launch day. I know how important that was to you.</Page>
			<Page>But with how frantic Chert was yelling, we decided we had to leave pretty quick.</Page>
			<Page>But hey, I just finished repairing and cleaning your ship. It's ready to fly!</Page>
			<Page>I did notice that there were some oddities with your ship log, though. I couldn't make heads or tails of it. Have you been modifying the ship without telling me?</Page>
