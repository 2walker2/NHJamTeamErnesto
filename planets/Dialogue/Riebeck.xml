			<Page>Well, the first thing I learned is that this planet is very scary.</Page>
			<Page>The second thing I learned is that it is filled with <![CDATA[<color=orange>sulfuric acid</color>]]>, which is also very scary. The acid is <![CDATA[<color=orange>falling</color>]]> though, which is nice. Must be all the geysers launching it into orbit.</Page>
			<Page>Thirdly, I found a Nomai <![CDATA[<color=orange>clock tower</color>]]> on the other side. Quite fascinating!</Page>
			<Page>I didn't go inside, because... well... it's scary.</Page>

			<Page>The tower on the other side of the moon? Obviously it's designed to keep time.</Page>
			<Page>The real question is this: WHY did they need to keep track of the time? Was it just to measure the passage of time? Were they counting down to something?</Page>
			<Page>That's the funny thing about the passage of time, <![CDATA[<color=orange>it makes it easy to forget</color>]]>. I know I never remember anything unless I <![CDATA[<color=orange>write it down</color>]]>.</Page>
			<Page>Wow, that sounded very profound.</Page>
			<Page>Maybe I should write that down...</Page>
